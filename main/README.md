This project involves detecting and analyzing geometric shapes in images to identify their symmetry lines. It includes preprocessing for enhanced edge detection, shape completion for missing contours, and generating an output image with highlighted symmetry lines. The project applies structural similarity metrics and symmetry detection algorithms to provide visual insights into the inherent symmetries of the detected shapes.
